At Umbraco HQ we have been running a cloud based Software as a Service offering for the past 5 years, and as both the product, our team and public cloud offerings have matured we have been using Serverless more and more. In this session I will share our journey into the Serverless landscape and how different Serverless use-cases have been growing on us and where we want to go with it in the future.
