The first product build specifically for Continuous Delivery pipelines came out over 10 years ago. The Continuous Delivery book came out 9 years ago. In the time since we've seen massive changes in the types of software we're building, testing and deploying. Yet the way we think about pipelines hasn't changed in many cases.

This talk will show several intertwined changes to how we think about pipelines to support the other changes in our industry.
