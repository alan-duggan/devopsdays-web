When people talk about scale, they immediately think it means scaling in traffic, or sales growth. But there are many different intentions when talking about scale. Things like expanding teams and dividing them into squads, or technological expansion, or expanding business or product lines. All these are scaling up, but they mean very different things.

So as a leading engineer, you need to first identify what the scalability issue at hand is and what the tech team needs to do in order to solve this problem. Next, you need to tailor a technological solution per issue, which means implementing new processes, teams, internal tools, and execution plans to scale successfully.
