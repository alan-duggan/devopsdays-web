A little about Kevin’s personal life in his own words… “I am a board game junkie and I will recruit for games at every possible opportunity. I have a 5 year old son named Jonah and my spouses name is Rachel. Jonah loves Legos as much as I do but I’m not if I should put the Death Star back together again for the 3rd time. I enjoy traveling, photography, hiking, camping, and HOCKEY. GO PREDS!!!!”
