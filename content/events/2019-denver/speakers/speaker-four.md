Sara is Director, BizOps Enable at Mastercard where she’s been working on DevOps transformation since she joined Mastercard in December 2017. Prior to joining Mastercard she worked at IBM for 12 years in a variety of development, management, and project management jobs that eventually led to being a key driver of DevOps transformation for one of IBM’s cloud offerings. Most of her career has been spent either in build tooling or Agile coaching so DevOps transformation is the perfect area to bring these skills together.
