My name is Kaylee Koch, I graduated from Colorado State University with a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial/Organizational Psychology – or Work Psychology. Due to my personal experience with those who work as Dev, DevOps, and Systems Engineers – my passion and research interests have fallen into how to best assist this community in particular. I look at my work/research interests as a preventative measure against physical/mental illness, as well as a way to assist in improving quality of life, and work/life balance in general. I love learning, and the open source movement of tech. has actually really inspired my take on academia - openly sharing all the information I have to help those who need it! When I’m not trying to help all the people, I enjoy spending time with my family, being with all the puppers, baking and reading.
