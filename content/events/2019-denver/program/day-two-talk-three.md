For many DevOps teams, their CI server has become just like the young shepherd-boy in the famous Aesop fable where he would cry wolf to falsely alarm the village to save their sheep. When the build is broken due to flaky automated tests, the team loses faith in the tests. How do we build the trust?

For many DevOps teams, their continuous integration builds have become just like the young shepherd-boy in the famous Aesop fable where he would cry wolf to falsely alarm the village to save their sheep. When the build breaks, team members assess the build. Yet, time and time again, they find that the application is working but that the tests are faulty and giving false alarms. Eventually, no one pays attention to the alerts anymore and lose faith in what was supposed to be a very important indicator. In this talk, Iâ€™ll explain how to save the sheep or in this case, the quality of the application. By following 5 steps to build stability within continuous integration tests, we can manage the automated tests that are failing and influence the perception of the credibility of the tests among stakeholders.
