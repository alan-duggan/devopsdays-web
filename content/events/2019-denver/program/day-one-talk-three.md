How Weedmaps transformed from going from Bi-Weekly releases to multiple releases a day and the various changes we made along the way. This talk will also offer other lessons learned along the way.

Topics to cover:

* Where we are now (multiple releases a day across 15+ projects)
* Where we were a few years ago (Bi-weekly releases/train/coordinated releases across less than 5 projects)
* Just because you are continuously releasing doesn’t mean that you’re practicing good Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployments
* Stopping the chaos
* How we reduced deployment times and improved MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)
* Using Circle 2
* Gathering Metrics and what to gather
* Standard metrics to measure
* Tools that we use to communicate across teams
* Improving Jira Tickets (3 Cs - Card/Conversation/Confirmation)
* Stickies are cool
* Moving notifications to Slack and pagerduty
