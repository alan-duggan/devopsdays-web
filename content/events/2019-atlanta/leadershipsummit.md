		<p>David Moschella - Seeing Digital</p>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">The Post-Cloud era has already begun. A powerful wave of new technologies, including machine learning, smart products, software agents, wearables, blockchains, speech/facial recognition, robotics, augmented realities, algorithms, and 5G wireless bandwidth is creating a digital world that is pervasive, embedded, aware, and autonomous. It's less a cloud of services somewhere “out there,” than a ubiquitous Matrix of intelligent capabilities. Seeing Digital shows how these exciting innovations will transform the industries, organizations, and careers of the 2020s.</p>

		<p>Simon Wardley - Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones</p>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Deng Xiaoping once described managing the economy as crossing the river by feeling the stones – in other words have a direction but be adaptive. But in a world of constant change, how do you determine the right thing to do? In this talk, we start by examining the issue of situational awareness and how it applies to technology. Using examples from government and the commercial world, we explore how you can map your environment, identify opportunities to exploit and learn patterns of change. Miss this pebble and you'll be swept away with history.</p>

		<p>Cat Swetel - Variety: The spice of Life and Secret to Scale</p>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Variety: The spice of Life and Secret to Scale </p>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">When we talk about “scale,” the conversation tends to be restricted to talk about scaling the size of the organization. What if negative consequences of scale eg silos, frustration, and even cumbersome expense policies are actually a consequence of attempting to scale the size of an organization without also scaling the amount of tolerable variety? Further, what if we should be doing more than just tolerating variety? What if increased space for (and decreased cost of) variety is a reason to scale, not just a curious byproduct?
<br/>
If you seek to scale variety, you must understand and overcome the natural human aversion to ambiguity. This session provides an approach for incurring variety where it makes sense within the coherence of a longer-term vision.</p>

        <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Mike Rother has been studying Toyota Production Systems (TPS) for almost three decades.  In 2009, in his book Toyota Kata, he explained how Toyota was able to achieve dominating success in the market for over 40 years using what he calls "meta-skills".  Put simply, he explained how Toyota acted like scientists in every facet of their business. Over the past few years, there have been numerous examples of how the ideas patterns and practices of Toyota Kata have been successfully used in Devops modern IT Transformations.  Leap to 2018 where there are now interesting conversations happening around Devops and Security.  This discussion has been coined as DevSecOps.  In this presentation, we are going to tie together the amazing Devops Kata work with some of the new ideas emerging with the DevSecOps discussions. </p>
