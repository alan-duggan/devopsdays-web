Tasshin Michael Fogleman is a long-term meditator with monastic training. His interest in Wardley Maps and other strategic tools comes from his time training in a monastery, where he faces questions of a strategic nature. Since most strategy has been developed in the military or business domains, he hopes to discover what monastic strategy might look like.
