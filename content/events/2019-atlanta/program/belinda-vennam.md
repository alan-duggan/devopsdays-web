The Knative open-source project promises to simplify how we build, deploy, and manage Serverless workloads on top of Kubernetes. We’ll discuss how Knative is attempting to address the promises of Serverless through the creation of their Build, Serving, and Eventing primitives.

Knative is a new open-source project with contributions from IBM, Google, Pivotal, and other industry leaders with deep experience in building their own Serverless platforms. This project promises to simplify how we build, deploy, and manage Serverless workloads on top of Kubernetes. In this talk, we’ll discuss what Serverless computing has promised developers, and how Knative is attempting to address those promises through the creation of their key primitives of Build, Serving, and Eventing. Join us to learn more about this exciting new project, and to learn more about the various Knative components available today.
