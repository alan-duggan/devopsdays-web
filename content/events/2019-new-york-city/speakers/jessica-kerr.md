Jessica Kerr is a developer at Atomist, where she writes open-source TypeScript to enable developers to automate our own work. She considers herself a symmathecist: a learning part of a learning team that includes software and humans, with a goal of impacting the world. She lives in St. Louis, Missouri, with two wonderful children and one infuriating cat. She travels to software conferences because she believes that what we learn from developing software can change the world in ways the software canâ€™t. Find her on twitter @jessitron and podcasting on Greater Than Code.
