Russ has a passion for working with the latest and greatest tools in application development, and an equal passion in teaching those tools to others. This is part of why he became a Technical Account Manager.

As a Technical Account Manager for Tasktop he gets to work with a variety of customers and help them connect the tools in their Software Delivery Life Cycle using Model-based integrations. Russ lends himself to those customers directly with technical support, escalation of issues, and awareness of new capabilities of the tool chain. With 60+ integration end points he gets to play with a lot of tools on a daily basis from Project Management, ALM tooling, Release Management, Automated Testing, Monitoring, and Metrics.
