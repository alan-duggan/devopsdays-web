Matt Ring is an Agile & Technical Coach at Principal Financial Group, a recovering (full-stack) app developer and former technical product owner over .NET development tooling used across the company. Mattâ€™s agile journey began in 2006 in stealth, when the idea of sticky notes over Gantt charts was heresy, and has gradually evolved from Kool-Aid Drinker to Agile Pragmatist. Matt now works with development and operational teams across Principal to help them improve upon their own agile, lean and DevOps practices.
