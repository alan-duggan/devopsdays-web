This talk will bring us back to basics and explain the core build building blocks of DevOps. With so many tools in the market it sometimes becomes over whelming for any one who is headed for a digital transformation. I will explain what is the essence of DevOps and that it is much more than just some tools and platforms. Its beyond tools and techs.
This talk will also help beginners to understand that just learning some tools does not make the DevOps engineers , its about adopting the DevOps mindset.
