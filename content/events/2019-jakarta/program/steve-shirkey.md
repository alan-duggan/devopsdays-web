How does Microsoft, the largest software developer in the world, run its own DevOps? It begins with seven key habits, and in this talk, we will share insights into what those are and how they helped Microsoft change its own culture to embrace DevOps. We will explore the challenges that DevOps brings and how a company building software for more than forty years was able to reinvent itself around a handful of simple practices and principles, and give you insight into the tools and platforms to either begin, or to strengthen, your own DevOps journey.
