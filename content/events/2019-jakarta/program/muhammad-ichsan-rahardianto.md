+++

Different architecture approach in multi tenancy SaaS, the trade offs between each architecture.
Briefly talk about Kubernetes and Istio, and afterwards talk about how it lowers the barrier in creating the most complex multi-tenancy setup, full isolation which offers the highest isolation between tenants. 
With which the SaaS provider can offer the highest security and data privacy between tenants, The setup would also be the best approach when both business scales and disaster happens. 
I will also introduce the devops toolchain that can help startups maintain the complex system with ease through automation, and with demo of course!
