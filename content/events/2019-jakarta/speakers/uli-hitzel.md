A software engineer who somehow also writes, produces videos and runs events.

I grew up in Johannes Gutenberg's neighborhood â€” you could say it was the Silicon Valley of the 15th century. Now, I usually don't have a beard, but the things I enjoy doing are at that same intersection of technology, content, design & repeatability.

As a technology evangelist, I'm working with modern, distributed systems. This usually includes a huge variety of concepts, platforms, and tools. Automation and open standards are essential to manage the complexity that comes with it - but ultimately, it's about culture & collaboration. I work on both sides of the story.
