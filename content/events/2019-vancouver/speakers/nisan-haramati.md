Nisan Haramati is a software engineer who works on distributed data systems and their verification at Wallaroo Labs.

Having built and supported a variety of large scale distributed systems, he is passionate about making it easier to build robust distributed applications that produce high quality data.

He likes to say that in an ideal world, the data would prove its own correctness, but in reality, we need to build trust in the systems that we use.

He has a B.Sc from the University of British Columbia.
