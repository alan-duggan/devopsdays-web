In this talk I'll provide several of my favorite ways Iâ€™ve gone about improving database reliability using the Go and other related tooling. Using several libraries; Cobra, Viper, and related tooling libraries the audience will learn about ways to rapidly prototype and put into production reliable and consistent CLI Apps for streamlining maintenance, operations, and deployment of database systems. There will be some extra focus on complex database systems too!

Once much of the deployment, maintenance, and operations are covered I have several repos with demos of tools available now for the audience and others to use (OSS Apache 2.0 Licensed) that they can use or reference today.

In conclusion between the technical examples and demos, and stories of my experience, attendees to this talk will walk away with numerous ways to improve their database reliability specifically and systems in general.
