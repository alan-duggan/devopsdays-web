Today, we are running hundreds of builds a day, spread across twenty different Jenkins servers, in a mixture of environments, and my team has the difficult task of maintaining them all. In order to support our build needs, we decided to migrate everything into a single cloud based, scalable solution on Kubernetes.

Jenkins is going through a major transition to become cloud ready, but it’s definitely not there yet. If you’re interested in running Jenkins on the cloud, or even some form of containerized Jenkins, I hope you can learn from the mistakes we made, as well as some of the more interesting ways we made Jenkins work for us.
