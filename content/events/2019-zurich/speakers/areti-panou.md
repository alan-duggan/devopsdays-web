A mathematician by vocation, a software tester by profession, I am now working as a cloud
quality coach, helping development teams within SAP come up with cloud quality strategies
that best fit their needs. Before that, I was the sole tester in one of the first products
at SAP, to put a full Continuous Delivery and DevOps approach into action, and the first
one in SAP history to daily deliver to its customers.

Iâ€™ve recently started blogging about the questions that occupy my mind regarding testing,
software development and quality at https://unremarkabletester.com/.
