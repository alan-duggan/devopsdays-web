I was born in Milan, where I studied Computer Sciences at the University of Milano-Bicocca
and started working on the eCommerce field with the SAP hybris platform. I moved to Zurich
at the end of 2015, always working on eCommerce on SAP hybris and moving steps toward
cloud-native architectures. Currently I work as Freelancer Software architect with
different customers on innovative cloud-native event-driven projects.
