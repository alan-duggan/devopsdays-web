Jorge enjoys monitoring all the things, from his Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters
to writing sensors plugins for DIY IoT projects with Raspberry PI and ESP8266. Currently
he is part of the Sysdig team, and in the past was one of the promoters of HumanOps and a
Debian developer. When he is away from computers, you will find him walking with his 2
dogs in the mountains or driving his car through a twisted road.
