I am a Continuous Delivery and DevOps consultant and teacher. I did not write the book on
DevOps, but I did [write the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPUKLfcuq9Y) for
DevOpsDays Copenhagen. I help companies both with process and culture, but I do enjoy it
when I can dive into the deep tech stuff. I am particular fond of Git, Jenkins,
Artifactory and Gradle as a toolstack. I maintain [Opinionated Git](http://opinionated-git.com),
[Exploring Agile Newsletter](http://randomsort.net/exploring-agile) and the best darn
[Git exercises around](https://github.com/praqma-training/git-katas). I enjoy programming,
music, gaming and being with my family of course :)
