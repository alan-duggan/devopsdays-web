MSc and PhD studies at ETH Zurich, focus on development of computational methods,
co-founder and Chief AI Officer of ambrite ag, a company focused on applied machine
learning for providing excellence in operational processes. I would love to talk about the
symbiosis of knowledge graph data models and deep learning methods in order to show how
certain processes within AIOps can be optimized.
