The world is changing. You went away from waterfall and plan-driven development to doing
agile. But why does agile not work? Why are you not faster and better and happier?
You installed Scrum Masters, you have boards for Transparency, you have a Definition Of
Done and you use Story Points. But did you really change your way of working?Â 
If a team believes they are agile, but nothing has changed about the way they test, they
are probably not there yet. Testing in an agile setup is completely different than in a
classical project.

In this workshop, we dive into the topic of testing. We will not focus on practicing TDD
or other practices but more on the principles of early and quick feedback and root cause
analysis. With 5 guiding principles about the agile testing mindset, we find ways and
things to take home and experiment for your organization.

I will run the workshop with my co-host Patrick Baumgartner.
