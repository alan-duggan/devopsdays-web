We've been focusing on the wrong part of CALMS. Sure you can set incentives, you can reorganize and adopt SCRUM, but rarely does one achieve a devops culture through business led "digital transformation". Paul will talk about the concrete steps that you as a leader, or you as a practitioner can utilize Automation, Measurement, and Sharing within a Lean framework and move the needle and drive towards a DevOps culture by doing the work and proving value.
