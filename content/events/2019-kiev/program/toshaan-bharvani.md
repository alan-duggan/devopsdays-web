The presentation describes how IT infrastructure has evolved from spaghetti infrastructure, a setup where organic growth and individual parts of the system were inter weaved into the architecture where developers were operations, the prevalence of virtualization and the increase in IT usage created individual layers in the infrastructure and created silos of specialization and this created a difference between developers making software and operations managing the infrastructure. From this lasagna based system, that was cumbersome and difficult to manage the idea of developer techniques and methodology were added to create teams, describing infrastructure as code. This lead to team being able to deliver software faster and deploy easier, the infrastructure was still not as agile, however in an effort to make infrastructure to be as agile the idea of containers where used to make infrastructure more agile, creating small environments for specific usage, to be able to manage it easier and quicker, and so the ravioli infrastructure was born. The presentation also side lines some examples more in detail and some misconceptions.
