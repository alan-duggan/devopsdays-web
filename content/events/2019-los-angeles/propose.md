DevOps Day LA is currently seeking speakers for 30 minute talks.

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _local practioners_: we want to highlight local work by practioners in the Southern California area.
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. You can demo at your table.

**Submit a proposal:** [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/oI729Mzrw1iUOBcy1)

**Rules:**
* Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)
* Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting
* Propose your own talk; don't have someone else do it for you.
* Nominations welcome... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps conversation, please point us in their direction!
* Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules

**Questions**: Email [{{< email_proposals >}}]
