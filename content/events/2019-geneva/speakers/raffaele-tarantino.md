CIOs and line-of-business executives are at the forefront of a major transformation aimed at leveraging the competitive advantages of the new hyper-connected enterprise. New IT for mobile devices, cloud services, social networks and big data analytics belong to the third platform, the next generation compute platform. We call this evolution to the third platform the “Idea Economy” because it gives IT the ability to drive new business opportunities by quickly delivering revenue-generating products, services, and experiences. Instead of just providing technology to automate internal business processes, IT can now directly impact business strategy and revenues by creating software-based services.

Embracing such transformation means to energize growth with strengthen profitability, boost the productivity, enhance innovation and increase organizational agility to improve the customer experience.
