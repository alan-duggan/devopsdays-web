The Docker democratization started long ago with developers. Containerization is very popular for stateless applications but nowadays databases are also becoming an important part of the customer CI/CD pipeline. Fortunately, Microsoft kept up by providing the support for MSSQL databases on Docker regardless the underlying operating system (Windows and Linux).

But implementing a CI/CD pipeline with SQL Server raises a lot of considerations from both Devs and Ops. This session aims to provide feedbacks and challenges we faced during the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline including a SQL database project and SQL Server containers in order to reduce the time-to-market for customers.
