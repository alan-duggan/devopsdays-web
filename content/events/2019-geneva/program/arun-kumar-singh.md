In this talk I will be sharing my Journey towards self healing infrastructure, which started with implementing self healing via SaltStack then Moving towards Rundeck and now finalised on StackStrom and How this self healing is helping us to resolve thousands of alerts without SRE intervention? This will include the pros-cons and high-lows we encountered in our journey while looking for a suitable workflow engine. How we added new things in existing technologies to make it fit for our environment and how user can learn from our mistakes and setup in your environment within hours.

I will be talking about different workflow engines and a brief comparison between them. What to be used when? and why not? etc
